Welcome to Chmbrs NotePad
============================================== 
Thank you for taking the time to download and install Chmbrs Note Pad.

This is a port of my Android app so it can run smoothly on the BlackBerry PlayBook

I am just a geek who wants to learn new things. I developed this small application just
for fun and to learn how to port applications to the BlackBerry PlayBook..
It has basically everything they suggest to have like Notifications, Basic Preferences Settings. 
I tried to follow all their good practices in UI and code.

Version 0.1 Beta (02/14/2012):	
	* Basic features like, new, edit, update, delete Notes.
	* Set reminders in notes.
	* Custom Preferences.
	* Export Notes.
	
Version 0.2 Beta (11/22/2012):	
	* More Tablet friendly by doing a complete UI redesign.
	* Portrait and Landscape support.
	* Some performance improvements.
	
I will try to keep this project alive and add more things. I have a lot of ideas
I just need more time.

This is my personal blog I will try to add more help and documentation once the
application is in the BlackBerry App World.
